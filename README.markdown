# jQuery CORS

The CORS capable XMLHttpRequest (XHR2) and XDomainRequest have somewhat different security properties than XHR1 and Active-whatever-thingy. As such, it is reasonable that apart from $.ajax there should also be $.cors which works cross-browser and supports cors-over-iframe for older browsers. This is the goal of jquery-cors.
